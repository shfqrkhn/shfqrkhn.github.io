# My Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio page, which is designed to be a live, dynamic showcase of all my public GitHub projects.

## ‚ú® About This Portfolio

Instead of a static site that requires manual updates, this portfolio automatically links to and highlights all of my other repositories.

The `index.html` file uses the GitHub API to:

* **Fetch All Repos**: It dynamically pulls in all of my public projects.
* **Stay Current**: Whenever I create or update a public repository on GitHub, it automatically appears here. There's no need for me to edit this page manually.
* **Highlight Key Projects**: My projects are automatically sorted to feature my most-starred work first.

The goal of this repository is to provide a clean, simple, and always up-to-date hub for anyone interested in my work.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It's Built

The page is built with simple and modern web technologies, requiring no backend or databases:

* **HTML**: For the basic structure.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For all styling and creating a responsive layout.
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: To communicate with the GitHub API and dynamically generate the project list.
* **GitHub API**: Serves as the live data source for all content.
